With the outbreak of the corona virus, I was motivated to write an
application to be the go-to source for the individuals and businesses 
who may need to the number of cases on the go.

All data used in this app is sourced from the John Hopkins Hospital website.
If you trust the John Hopkins Hospital then you can trust the information this app
provides. The information provided by this app is real-time.

I'd like to thank Eddie, Senyo, Samantha, Penuel and Solomon for their contributions
for the projects. Thanks guys.

This is not the final product. I will update this app from time to time to add more
features.
