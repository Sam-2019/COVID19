With the outbreak of the Corona Virus, as developer, I was motivated to write an
application to be the go-to source for the individuals and businesses who may need
to the number of cases on the go.

All data used in this application is sourced from the John Hopkins Hospital website.
The information is realtime and genuine.

If you trust the John Hopkins Hospital then you can trust the information this application
provides.

I'd like thank some friends and family who supported me in this endeavor.
Eddie, Senyo, Samantha, Penuel, Judith and Solomon, thanks guys for all feedback.

This is not the final product. I will continue to work to implement more features
to make the application an enviable one.
